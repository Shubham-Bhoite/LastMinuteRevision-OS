# 1) What is an operating system?
-  It is a program that provides an interface between the software and hardware of a computer. In other words, an operating system offers an environment for the user to execute software using hardware.
-  Your Application do not need interact directy with hardware, Applications talk to the operating system and operating systems talk with the hardware.
----
# 2) Types of operating system?
According to the functionality that operating Systems provides the types are:
-   1] Single Tasking System: This OS are very very basic. They do not provide multiple functionality they just exist in Ram. They are loaded in the ram then they allow only one processor to be there in the Ram at a time and to be run at a time.
  -   Eg: MS-DOC

-   2] Multitasking: It is a system that allows more efficient use of computer hardware. This system works on more than one task at one time by rapidly switching between various tasks. These systems are also known as time-sharing systems.

-   3] Multiprocessing: It is a system that allows multiple or various processors in a computer to process two or more different portions of the same program simultaneously. It is used to complete more work in a shorter period of time.

-   4] Multithreading: In multithreading you have multiple threads running within a process in interleaved fashion.

# 3) What is Kernel ? Explain the types of kernel ==>
The kernel is basically a computer program usually considered as a central component or module of OS. It is responsible for handling, managing, and controlling all operations of computer systems and hardware. Whenever the system starts, the kernel is loaded first and remains in the main memory. It also acts as an interface between user applications and hardware.

## Types of Kernel:
-  Monolithic Kernel: In this type of OS kernel, all user and kernel services reside in the same memory space. Old operating systems would use this type of kernel. Some examples are Windows 95, 98, and Unix. Linux also uses it.

-  MicroKernel: This kernel type is small, and all the user and kernel services reside in different memory addresses. Operating systems like macOS and Windows use microkernels.

# 4) Difference between Kernel and OS?
-   Kernel: Kernel is a system program that controls all programs running on the computer. The kernel is basically a bridge between the software and hardware of the system.

-   Operating System: Operating system is a system program that runs on the computer to provide an interface to the computer user so that they can easily operate on the computer.

# 5) What is a process? Name all the states of a Process ?
-   A process is a program in execution. when a program goes to RAM and start running then become a process.
-   All the states of process are defined in the image below:

# 6) What is a thread?
-  A thread is a lightweight process that shares the same memory space as the parent process. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single process. Basically, It is a path of execution that is composed of the program counter, thread id, stack, and set of registers within the process.

# 7) What is difference between process and thread?

# 8) What is Starvation and Aging?
-  Starvation: It is generally a problem that usually occurs when a process has not been able to get the required resources it needs for progress with its execution for a long period of time. In this condition, low priority processes get blocked and only high priority processes proceed towards completion because of which low priority processes suffer from lack of resources.

-  Aging: It is a technique that is used to overcome the situation or problem of starvation. It simply increases the priority of processes that wait in the system for resources for a long period of time. It is considered the best technique to resolve the problem of starvation as it adds an aging factor to the priority of each and every request by various processes for resources. It also ensures that low-level queue jobs or processes complete their execution.

# 9) What is Context Switching?
-  Context switching is basically a process of saving the context of one process and loading the context of another process. It is one of the cost-effective and time-saving measures executed by CPU because it allows multiple processes to share a single CPU. This technique is used by OS to switch a process from one state to another i.e., from running state to ready state.

# 10)  Difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?

# 11) What is a Scheduling Algorithm? Name different types of scheduling algorithms.
-  A scheduling algorithm is a process that is used to improve efficiency by utilizing maximum CPU and providing minimum waiting time to tasks. It is used to allocate resources among various competing tasks.

### Types of Scheduling Algorithm:
